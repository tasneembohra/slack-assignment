Slack assignment to search user by keyword

Note: I have created new project from scratch as the project provided is using older libs and not working with Mac M1, due to the timing issues, I though it would be best to create new on my system.

Plesse let me know if this is not acceptable, I will update the provided project accordingly. Thanks!  

Documentation in progress, please check back on Sept 7
